Calculator for my hs math classes

I wanted to add a bit of a challange to them and I felt that this was the way to do it. Each time I move into a new unit, I will attempt to add the needed functionality before the unit is over.

Using PLY, the calculator is basically implementing a very simple language of its own that can store variables and use functions. (That's the plan at least.)
