			<h1>What is advcalc?</h1>
			<hr width="250px" align="LEFT">
			<p>advcalc is a project of mine to add a challenge to my highschool math classes and also over time make the classes easier by making an efficient calculator program.</p>
			<p>It's basically a miniature programming language built on PLY (Python Lex-Yacc) that only works with mathematical operators. This is meant to make the code more efficient and make the software easier to use.</p>

			<h1>What can it do right now?</h1>
			<hr width="350px" align="LEFT">
			<h3>advcalc can currenty:</h3>
			<div name="functionality">
				<li>Tokenize integers</li>
				<li>Tokenize operators (+, -, *, /)</li>
				<li>Tokenize FLOAT, NAME, and EQUALS</li>
				<li>Return the tokenized integers and operators in a tree format (tuple)</li>
				<li>Actually carry out the functions of the operators (execution)</li>
				<li>Allow the usage of variables</li>

			<h1>What is planned for the near future?</h1>
			<hr width="500px" align="LEFT">
			<div name="future">
				<li>Add parentheses and exponents</li>
				<li>Add distance formula and midpoint formula</li>
				<li>Add stored custom formulas</li>
			</div>

			<h1>How does it work?</h1>
			<hr width="250px" align="LEFT">
			<div name="how?">
				<p>Using the python library PLY, the code takes in integers, operators, decimals, and variables. Currently, it executes the 4 basic mathematical operations and can use variables. I do not envy developers who write actual fully fledged languages. This is hard enough for me to make compact and well written, so I'm absolutely blown away by the complexity of other languages.</p>

		<p>These docs will get extended as this project gets more advanced. Right now, it's really simple.</p>
